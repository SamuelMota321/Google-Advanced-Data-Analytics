## 👋 Hello, I'm Samuel

I'm a Computer Science student, Web Developer, and Data Science enthusiast. This repository documents my entire learning journey through the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate on Coursera.

Before starting this program, I completed a Data Science residency at my university, where I gained hands-on experience with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning workflows.
Now, with this certificate, I'm deepening my knowledge and expanding my skill set in areas such as statistical modeling, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making.

This repository will serve as a central hub for my notes, projects, exercises, and insights throughout the course.
